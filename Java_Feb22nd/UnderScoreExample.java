/*

In earlier java versions ie, upto 7,Underscore(_) is used as identifier and as a variable name also.
But from Java 9 ,Underscore (_) cannot be used as an identifier as it is considered as a "KEYWORD"
So,whenever we try to use it as identifier its returns compile time error from jdk versions 9 onwards.

java: as of release 9, '_' is a keyword, and may not be used as an identifier
